# The "sp" in the filename is for (Intuit) Services Platform, the
# original name of what is now Java Service Kit; we haven't renamed
# everything (yet).
#
# The "boot" refers to Spring Boot, though ample boots is an acceptable
# interpretation.
#
# The contents of this file formerly resided in "common.properties.to-be-deleted" and
# "config.properties.to-be-deleted".   The names of the properties have been changed to
# protect the innocent.  Also to better reflect the new organization.
# the old names are including below in comments, to provide assistance in
# migrating.
#
# Note that this one YAML file *could* hold all the values for all the
# different configuration profiles, but for various reasons we highly
# recommend breaking those out into separate files with one or at most
# a few tightly-related profiles.
#
# See also "bootstrap.properties" and "application.properties.to-be-deleted", which
# have lower precedence than this file.  And be aware that the highest
# precedence is given to environment variables and command-line JVM
# properties.
#
# See yaml.org for syntax details, and this may be interesting:

## What is now in jsk-core-props' ServiceInfoProperties bean, used throughout JSK:

# old naming not yet updated:
sp_service_swagger_api_version: 2.0

---

## Gateway LastMileVerifier has been reworked, see LastMileProperties class
## in jsk-servlet-gateway-lastmile-filter.

# Some of these values must be overridden in specific environments

---

## Healthcheck now has a property to determine whether you are using the
## default "service" or the file-checking one.  Here are the old values.

## See the classes in the "autoconfig" package of jsk-servlet-health.
## dirToWatch could use ${catalina.base} if using multitenancy.

## And now the long list of properties for the CommonServiceLogFilter
## in jsk-servlet-logging-filter (see also jsk-servlet-logging-utils).
## (Note that this module is due for a lot of rework, so don't obsess with
## the details here.)

# In jsk-servlet-logging-utils, look at class LoggingProperties.
# Retired (never implemented): log4j.mdc.json-format.software, .hostname, .merchantaccount
# Retired: log4j.mdc.json-format.type.log-incoming-request-event, .log-outgoing-request-event
# Renamed: log4j.mdc.json-format.request-info -> js
